**PC Part Recommender:**
This project takes in user inputs for budget and CPU/GPU Brand preferences, and then suggests diverse potential builds within that budget. These include builds that have very high price-to-performance ratios, as well as builds with specs such as higher ram or storage for use cases aside from gaming.The data will be updated frequently to ensure prices reflect the actual market, as well as adding new parts which are released. 
The reason I made this project is because it can be very daunting for people who don't have much domain knowledge regarding building PCs to choose the right set of parts. My project ensures that all the parts are compatible with each other, as well as suggesting combinations which will provide the most value for their budget.
