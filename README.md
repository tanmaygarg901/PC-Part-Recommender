**PC Part Recommender:**
This project takes in user inputs for budget and CPU/GPU Brand preferences, and then suggests diverse potential builds within that budget. These include builds that have very high price-to-performance ratios, as well as builds with specs such as higher ram or storage for use cases aside from gaming.The data will be updated frequently to ensure prices reflect the actual market, as well as adding new parts which are released.
